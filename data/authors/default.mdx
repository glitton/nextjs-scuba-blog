Scuba diving is my form of meditation. I grew up in Manila Philippines where I learned how to scuba dive. I took a break when I moved to San Francisco, California but got back in the water in 2013, this time prepared for the cold temperatures - dry suit certified!

I've gone diving in the colder waters of California including Monterey and the Channel Islands. Besides diving California and the Philippines, I've also dove various parts of the Caribbean including Cozumel, Puerto Morelos, Little Cayman, Roatan, Cayos Cochinos, and Utila. I also dove the Revillagigedo Archipelago aka Socorro Islands and more recently, Raja Ampat, Indonesia. I have plans to dive more so stay tuned!

In 2021, my wife and I decided to move to Puerto Morelos Mexico where I obtained my divemaster certification. Along with assisting scuba instructors, I also enjoy photographing the unique creatures of the ocean and their environment.

I started this blog when my nephew, Sean Litton, unexpectedly passed away in 2021 due to Covid-19. Sean was an avid scuba diver and whenever I visited the Philippines, I'd go on a trip with him. I miss him very much 😢.

Through my blogs, I feel like Sean is still diving with me. I aim to share with Sean (and all of you 😸) the wonders of the ocean and share all its beauty 🐠 🐙 🐡.

Thanks for checking out my blogs and photos. Hasta Luego 🤟!
