<small>Rhinopias: Can you spot it's eyes?</small>

One of the joys of underwater photography is finding weird and unusual critters. Although diving Anilao is known for seeing various nudibranchs there are also a number of unusual critters roaming the sandfloor such as the rhinopias which comes from a family of scorpionfishes.

Another one is this fish which has wings and things on its mouth. It walks the ocean floor. I learned that it is a dragonet, specifially a wongat dragonet

Here's another type of dragonet, which is a more colorful one.

We also saw a type of scorpion fish that hangs out with yellow gobies.

As well as the hairy variety aka hairy scorpionfish.

Others were so tiny or easily camouflaged that it was hard to see them except through my macro lens.

Like this hairy shrimp which to the naked eye looked like a piece of brown cotton on the sea floor.

This tiny horned shrip was so small. Fingernail and pointy stick for perspective.

Cool to see this pair of anemone shrimp.

Is this a branch floating near the sea fan? It looks like a pipefish of some sort.

I saw other critters under the sand, among anemones and inside bottles even! [Check out the pics](https://generosalitton.smugmug.com/AnilaoWeirdCritters-040124/n-c9c785) to see them all.
