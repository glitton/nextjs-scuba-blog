Shaun the sheep or Costasiella kuroshimae, is a very tiny nudibranch measuring less than 5mm in size. They are found on algae that looks like a small green leaf. It got its name as it looks like a sheep grazing on grass.
It is very difficult to see it with the naked eye so thankfully my 90mm macro lens captured some of its details.

With the help of our experienced guide, we saw other tiny nudibranchs that were about half an inch in size max.

The above is a Flabellina variety.

This one seems to be related to Shaun the sheep but it is bigger about 1.5cm in size.

This one looks like a nudi but it's actually a flatworm or a Pseudoceros bifurcus. I love it's cool blue color with orange head stripe.

This lemon nudi was also very cool looking, it's scientific name is Diversidoris crocea.
