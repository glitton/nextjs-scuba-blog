<small>Very tiny barred hamlet fish</small>

You're probably wondering why am I quoting Shakespeare's Hamlet. 🎭 👑 💀

During this trip, my dive buddies Camille and Kyle introduced me to very beautiful fish, the Hamlet! 🐠

There were several dives where Camille was trying to get my attention but alas, I was too far. She found a shy hamlet (quite rare) so that was a bummer that I missed it.

During my last dive, Kyle gave me the "Hamlet" hand signal (hand raised with finger extended) and he found the another barred hamlet!

Besides the hamlets, I was able to spot the usual suspects in Cozumel specifically one of my favorites, the splendid toadfish!

The drumfish, and of course the file fish which always swim in pairs.

One rare sighting was that of an electric ray resting in the sand.

We were fortunate to have over 50 feet of visibility making photography such a delight.
