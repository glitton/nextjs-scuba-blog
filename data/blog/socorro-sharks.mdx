<small>Galapagos shark swimming with butterfly fish</small>

This is my second time diving the Socorro Islands. The first time was in December of 2023. The difference that I noticed scuba diving in April versus December was the water temperature. Definitely much colder in April which meant more sharks! ðŸ¦ˆ ðŸ¦ˆ ðŸ¦ˆ.

The cleaning station in the site called El CaÃ±on in San Benedicto Island was teeming with various types of sharks. I was able to photograph a bunch of them including a galapagos, (first photo), white tip reef sharks,

and most exciting, a school of hammerheads!

Hammerhead sharks are very shy and it is best to not use any lights in their presence and not scare them away. When you see one swimming, it is the "sentinel" or "soldier" hammerhead checking to see if the waters are safe. Then it is followed by a school of hammerhead sharks. Sure enough, when the one swam by, he was followed by more than 10!

Check out the video of the white tip reef sharks and school of hammerheads. It's a bit grainy as I didn't use my lights but you get to see the sharks.
