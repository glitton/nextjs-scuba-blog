Our first four dive days was spent in the Northern part of the Raja Ampat region. The average water temperature was a warm 83 degrees and there were numerous bleached coral which was very sad to see. But hey, climate change is a hoax, right?

Nevertheless, the highlight of the dives was the Wobbegong shark!

At first, it was very difficult to spot it, as they are masters of disguise. With the help of the guide, I got to see the strange shark.
