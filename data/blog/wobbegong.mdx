Our first four dive days was spent in the Northern part of the Raja Ampat region. The average water temperature was a warm 83 degrees and there were numerous bleached coral which was very sad to see. But hey, climate change is a hoax, right? NOT!!!

Nevertheless, the highlight of the dives was seeing several Wobbegong sharks!

At first, it was very difficult to spot it, as they are masters of disguise. With the help of the guide, I got to see this strange shark.

Fun facts about the Wobbegong Shark (source: Google search AI results)

1. Camouflage - Wobbegongs have distinctive patterned skin that helps them blend in with the seafloor.
2. Nocturnal - Wobbegongs are nocturnal, resting during the day and hunting at night. They sleep in caves, reefs, or on the seafloor.
3. Skin - Wobbegong skin is used to make leather in Australia.
4. Ambush predators - Wobbegongs are lazy hunters that wait for prey to come close, then attack. They use their barbels and lobes to lure prey.
5. Powerful jaws - Wobbegongs have powerful jaws and sharp teeth. They can dislocate their jaws to suck in large prey in one gulp.

The reefs in the Northern part of Raja Ampat boasted numerous schools of sweet lips and lettuce coral.

At one location near a jetty, I spotted this bumphead wrasse swimming about around 20 feet below the surface.
