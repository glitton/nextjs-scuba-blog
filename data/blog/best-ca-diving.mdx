This year's Labor Day weekend 2024, I had the chance to scuba dive the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Clemente and Catalina) with [Adventure Sports Unlimited] (https://asudoit.com/) aboard the Vision.

Blackwater diving is done in the middle of the ocean often with depths of thousands of feet. We set out at 7 pm for our destination of Balayan Bay.

When we reached our spot, the boat team lowered a buoy with floodlights set up at 5 meters, 10 meters and 15 meters. These lights serve as our reference point and also attract various ocean nightlife.

Towards the last 10 minutes of our dive, our guide spotted a [paper nautilus aka argonaut](https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2020/10/05/paper-nautilus/) which is a type of octopus typically found on the deeper side, closer to 100 feet. He spotted the critter at around 85 feet so my buddy, Linda Elliott and me swam down to capture photos of this guy ðŸ“¸ ðŸŽ¥ ðŸŽ‰.
