This year's Labor Day weekend 2024, I had the chance to scuba dive the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Clemente and Catalina) aboard the Vision led by Emily and Ryan of [Adventure Sports Unlimited](https://asudoit.com/).

Along the way, my buddy Linda Elliott and I, stopped by Monterey as I needed to visit Backscatter and get something fixed in my camera housing. We heard about all the sea lions hanging out at San Carlos beach and boy where there a lot of them! According to marine biologists with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, these sea lions which were mostly male, just migrated from the Channel Islands. They are making a stop in Monterey due to the abundance of their food supply. 🦭 🐟 🦭

We arrived at the Santa Barbara harbor around 6:30 pm and boarded the Vision. Our first stop the next day was Santa Barbara Island. We got our feet wet at 8 am and the water temperature was a balmy 66 degrees. Thanks to my dry suit (which continues to shrink!), I was quite toasty 😊.

We were greeted by the very lush kelp forest, Garibaldi, and various sheep head.

About 15 minutes into the dive and to my delight, a Giant Sea Bass appeared and hung out with us for 40 minutes (more about this in a separate blog) ! 🎉 🤩 🥳

We dove San Clemente and Catalina islands as well and had superior conditions. Hardly any current, minimal swell and temperatures ranging from 60 degrees to 68 degrees.

California diving is never complete without a visit from a very playful sea lion pup. We encountered this guy during our last day back in Santa Barbara Island.
