This year's Labor Day weekend 2024, I had the chance to scuba dive the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Clemente and Catalina) aboard the Vision led Emily and Ryan of [Adventure Sports Unlimited](https://asudoit.com/).

Along the way, my buddy Linda Elliott and I, stopped by Monterey as I needed to visit Backscatter and get something fixed in my camera housing. We heard about all the sea lions hanging out at San Carlos beach and boy where there a lot of them! According to marine biologists with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, these sea lions which were mostly male, just migrated from the Channel Islands. They are making a stop in Monterey due to the abundance of their food supply.

Towards the last 10 minutes of our dive, our guide spotted a [paper nautilus aka argonaut](https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2020/10/05/paper-nautilus/) which is a type of octopus typically found on the deeper side, closer to 100 feet. He spotted the critter at around 85 feet so my buddy, Linda Elliott and me swam down to capture photos of this guy ðŸ“¸ ðŸŽ¥ ðŸŽ‰.
