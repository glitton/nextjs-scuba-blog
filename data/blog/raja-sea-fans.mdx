Besides the sometimes strong currents, Raja Ampat boasted a very vibrant sea environment full of schools of fish, various types of corals and lots and lots of sea fans, one on top of the other.

There were an abundance of these large lettuce coral such as the picture below. Notice Linda in the photo for perspective on the size of the coral ðŸ˜®.

The schools of fish and variety were different from any other place I've gone diving thus far.
