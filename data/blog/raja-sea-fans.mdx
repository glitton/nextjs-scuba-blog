Besides the sometimes strong currents, Raja Ampat boasted a very vibrant sea environment full of schools of fish, various types of corals and lots and lots of sea fans, one on top of the other.

Here's a photo of Deb Stewart photographing me while hooked on a reef as well as a shot of her "flying" in the current.

And here's a shot of Linda at Boo Window where she's hanging on and trying to not get swept by the currents ðŸ˜‚.
