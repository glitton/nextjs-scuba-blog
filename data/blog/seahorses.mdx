Days 4 and 5 of my Roatan Honduras Liveaboard brought us to the island of Utila. Many of my dive friends head to this island to dive with the whale sharks which weren't in season (they usually show up around the end of February through April).

Nevertheless, we had other critters to seek specifically seahorses! We headed to various sites called Jack Neil's, Spanish Bay, Cannery Bank, and the Pinnacle.

We saw not one, not two, not three, but four seahorses in the Pinnacle dive site.

I was able to photograph three out of the four as these guys get very annoyed with us paparazzi.

Of course, I spotted some blennies including a yellow one which I haven't seen yet in this trip.

And a goby hanging on top of a brain coral.

It was so cool to see these critters. Check out [more pics](https://generosalitton.smugmug.com/Roatan-Aggressor-Sept-2023/RoatanJackNeals/n-vgBMsm/) of the seahorses and other various small guys.

The night dive took us to Spanish Bay where I witnessed these white crabs fighting. I couldn't tell what they were until I processed my photos, they looked like specks of dust!
