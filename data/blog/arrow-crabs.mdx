I lost the lens cap to my macro port at the Scuba Club Cozumel house reef so I decided to do a last dive during the afternoon of June 2 in search for this item. I knew it was close to impossible to find it but hey, why not give it a try? You never know, right? ðŸ˜œ

I retraced my steps and couldnâ€™t help but photograph more blennies!!!

After searching for about 30 minutes, I gave up and decided to just continue exploring. I went to the left side of the reef and got to the bottom of the main buoy and lo and behold, I noticed some arrow crabs mating! ðŸ˜®

I learned that during mating, the male arrow crab holds the female against his belly to deposit a sperm packet into the female crab.

The dance lasted about five minutes, so quite efficient, eh?

I also got a close up of a grey angel fish and also saw some juveniles but they moved so fast, that I couldnâ€™t get a good shot.

Heading back to shore, I spotted a fireworm which, if touched, produces a painful burning sensation. ðŸ˜±

Look but donâ€™t touch por favor!

It was a lovely time in Cozumel and Iâ€™ll surely be back! ðŸ‘‹
