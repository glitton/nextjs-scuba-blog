Scuba diving the Revillagigedos Archipelago (pronounced reh-vi-ya-heh-hih-dos, aka Socorro Islands) has been on my bucket list and thanks to the enthusiasm and great planning skills of Linda Elliott, my dream has been fulfilled!

The trip started from Cabo San Lucas where we boarded the Nautilus Undersea vessel (add history of this boat) at 8pm on Saturday night.

We then motored to San Benedicto that evening and by the end of the day Sunday, we anchored in our first dive site in San Benedicto Island.

The trip was relatively smooth with gentle rolling waves which helped me get a good night's sleep.

Our first dive was at the site called Fundadero where the goal was to check if all our gear was working, weights were appropriate and in general to get comfortable.

The water temperature was around 78 degrees and viz was decent, about 40 feet. I started off wearing my chillproof sharkskin which is supposed to handle temps up to 68 degrees. Alas, I was cold with just that suit so for the next dive, I added another 2mm layer, my Lavacore.

The second dive was at the site called the Canyon where within the first minute under water, I saw my first manta! Check out the video below. Isn't she such a magestic creature?

My buddy Linda also spotted a hammerhead shark! Other cool critters that we spotted included an electric shark which are ...

a "big ass" lobster,

and a turtle.

I even saw an octopus out in the open! Check it out using the link to my pictures below.

Currents were a bit strong and it kept shifting causing surges that kept me very alert. I had to stragegically swim behind rocks to get protection but all in all, I was so happy to have had a great first dive day!
