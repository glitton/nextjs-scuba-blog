Scuba diving the Revillagigedos Archipelago (pronounced reh-vi-ya-heh-hih-dos, aka Socorro Islands) has been on my bucket list for some time. Thanks to the enthusiasm and great planning skills of Linda Elliott, my dream has been realized and what a trip it was!

The trip started from Cabo San Lucas where we boarded the Nautilus Undersea vessel at 8pm on Saturday night. The boat's claim to fame is that it was a support boat for the James Bond Movie "License to Kill" and was used for the Deep Rover mission with Dr. Silvia Earle.

The plan for the week was to do our first dive in San Benedicto Island, then head on to Roca Partida then to Socorro Island and then back to do our last dives in San Benedicto Island. The captain informed us that plans can change depending on weather and dive conditions thus, flexibility and an adventurous attitude was needed.

We motored to San Benedicto that evening and by the end of the day Sunday, we anchored in our first dive site in San Benedicto Island.

The trip was relatively smooth with gentle rolling waves which helped me get a good night's sleep.

Our first dive was at the site called Fundadero where the goal was to check if all our gear was working, weights were appropriate, and in general to get comfortable.

The water temperature was around 78 degrees and viz was decent, about 40 feet. I started off wearing my chillproof Sharkskin suit which was supposed to handle temps up to 68 degrees. Alas, I was cold with just that suit thus for the next dive, I added another 2mm Lavacore layer.

The second dive was at the site called the Canyon where within the first minute under water, I saw my first manta!

Isn't she such a magestic creature?

My buddy Linda also spotted a hammerhead shark! Other cool critters that we spotted included a Cortez Electric Ray

I even saw an octopus out in the open! Check it using the link to my pictures below.

Currents were a bit strong and it kept shifting causing surges that kept me very alert and also made visibility a bit murky. I had to stragegically swim behind rocks to get protection but all in all, I was so happy to have had a great first dive day!
