<small>Nudibranchs mating</small>

Animal behavior is always an interesting thing to photograph. For this blog, I've captured mating and critters guarding their eggs.

Interesting fact: all nudibranchs are hermaphrodites, which means they can be both a female and a male. Mating pairs inject sperm into each other by a penis ðŸ’ž.

<small>Do you see the penis between the two nudis?</small>

Here's a shot of a nembrotha nudi seemingly pooping out something ðŸ’© ðŸ’© ðŸ’©. What is it?

I also photographed numerous critter parents like this mantis guarding its eggs.

And this Nemo clownfish not letting me near its babies.

<small>Eggs are to the left of the clownfish</small>

I didn't notice the eggs on this shrimp until I took a closer look. It's always nice to discover things after the shot was taken!

Another surprise discovery is this shot of Sawblade shrimp (thanks Linda Elliott for correcting me, I thought it was a pipefish) with eggs in its belly area!
