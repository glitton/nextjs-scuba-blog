One of the bonuses of diving the Revillegigedo Islands is a chance for dolphin sightings. As you can never tell with mother nature, seeing dolphins in the wild was never a sure thing. However, in this trip, I spotted them not once, not twice, but at least three times underwater and a few times on while on the boat!

We first spotted dolphins as we rode the skiff to the dive site at Roca Partida. But the next time we got to see and have significant interaction with them was at the Cabo Pierce site on Socorro Islands.

As dolphins are delightful and beautiful, it is very easy to get distracted while filming them. It's very common that dolphins start leading you deeper than your desired depth. The first time I filmed them, I saw that my depth 120 feet!!!

Diving Cabo Pierce, a small pod of four dolphins decided to delight our divemaster, Mari! Check out her glorious screams and "hola" in the video below.

We did four dives on Roca Partida, starting off on one end of the island and then letting the current take us to the other end.

Water temperature was steady at 78 degrees with the occasional thermocline at 77 degrees. By this time, I was wearing my 5mm wetsuit 🥶. Photo of me below taken by Linda Elliott 📷.

This island is known for the abundance of white tip reef sharks laying on top of each other on ledges or crevices. Seeing these sharks in real life was definitely a delight 👀 😂. White tip reef sharks are pretty harmless so getting up close to them was not scary at all.

The sharks were also hovering around 40 feet along with the schools of fish and looked to be feeding on the plankton.

Other critters from diving this island included trumpet fish (even a yellow one!), large schools of jacks and more dolphin sightings. More about the dolphins on the next blog 😁 🐬.
