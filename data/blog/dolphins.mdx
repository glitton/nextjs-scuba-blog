One of the bonuses of diving the Revillegigedo Islands is a chance for dolphin sightings. As you can never tell with mother nature, seeing dolphins in the wild is never a sure thing. However, in this trip, I spotted them not once, not twice, but at least three times underwater and a few times while on the boat!

We first spotted dolphins as we rode the skiff to the dive site at Roca Partida. But the next time we got to see and have significant interaction with them was at the Cabo Pierce site on the actual island of Socorro.

As dolphins are delightful and beautiful, it is very easy to get distracted while filming them. It's very common that dolphins start leading you deeper than your desired depth. The first time I filmed them, I got pulled down to a depth 120 feet 😵‍💫 !!!

Our divemaster reminded us "remember, to watch your depth, you are not a dolphin!" 🐬 🐬 🐬 🐬

Diving Cabo Pierce in the actual Socorro Island, a small pod of four dolphins decided to delight our divemaster, Mari!
