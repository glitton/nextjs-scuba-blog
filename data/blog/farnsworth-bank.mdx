My earliest memory about scuba diving the Channel Islands is a site off Catalina Island called Farnsworth Bank. It is located about 1.6 miles off Catalina Island and it boasts a series of mountains and pinnacles. We dove the main pinnacle that had a top depth of 55 feet and went as deep as 130 feet.

We had perfect conditions and took advantage of the 60+ feet visibility and happily dove the site three times!

The main attractions for me were the beautiful purple hydrocoral, kelp forests, a torpedo ray, and a bait ball of sardines!

I learned that the purple hydrocoral (Stylaster californicus) is not a true coral because it is not a reef building stony coral. Nevertheless it provided a very beautiful contrast to the landscape and sea life. <br/>🔆 🌿 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒₊˚ʚ 🌱 ₊˚✧ 🎏

In all of the three dives, I spotted a slowly gliding torpedo ray.

The ray aka the Pacific electric ray which can generate up to 45 volts of electricity for the purposes of subduing prey or self-defense. So look but don't touch! 😱 ⚡ 🔌 ⚡ 😱

However, the highlight for me was meeting the devil of the Farnsworth kelp aka Linda Elliott. She was hiding behind the kelp and was nice enough to say hello 😈 👋 🤘🏼 😈.

Linda had on a hood with red horns making her so easy to spot. She was the subject of many photographs and we had many fun moments playing around. 😂 😆 😜

In addition to the spectacular dive conditions, we were enveloped by schools of sardines. On occasion sea lions and sea gulls would dive down to catch the bait. Check out the video with a special appearance by the devil herself, Linda Elliott 😈.
