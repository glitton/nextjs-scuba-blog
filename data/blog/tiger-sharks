Fuvamulah is known for tiger shark diving 🦈. I was so excited to get to this destination and dive with these sharks. However, the reefs are also very diverse with unique corals, (mushroom shaped, table, branching), deep walls, sharks, mantas, sea life and macro critters. Some divers even saw a thresher shark lurking in the deep end.

What I really liked about diving in the Maldives was the variety of butterfly fish. I tried to photograph them but they would always swim away. Here's one I manage to capture with a squirrel fish.

These fish are often found in pairs and when I tried to photograph them, they'd always evaded me. I got lucky with these guys but not many others. 😔

I also found many Nemos aka clownfish. But in the photo below, there were numerous juvenile black damsel fish hanging out with them. 🐟 👶 🐟

I learned that the young damsel fish were mimicking the clownfish's symbiotic relationship with the anemone for protection against predators. When they grow, they lose this behavior.

There were a lot of little critters too but I didn't bring my macro lens. Fortunately my buddy Linda had hers. 💥

All macro photos below were taken by Linda Elliott 🩵.

And this critter is actually a juvenile sea cucumber and not a nudibranch! 🤩
