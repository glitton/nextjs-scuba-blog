Blackwater diving has become very popular in underwater photography circles. This was my second time doing it and boy was I rewarded. We spotted a [paper nautilus aka argonaut](https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2020/10/05/paper-nautilus/) which is a type of octopus. Many of my scuba diving friends have done blackwater dives for over a year without seeing one so we were truly lucky!

Photographing this guy and other critters is not easy as they move so quickly. Fortunately I captured the nautilus on video.
