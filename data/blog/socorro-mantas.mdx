The main reason I wanted to dive the Revillagigedos Islands was to see giant manta rays. Although we saw them in each of our dives, they were aplenty at the various sites of Socorro Island including Cabo Pierce and Punta Tosca.

The giant oceanic manta ray can grow up to 30 feet in length and to a disc size of 23 feet across. They have triangular pectoral fins which serve as their "wings" and a pair of cephalic fins at the front of their heads.

Our divemaster reminded us "remember, to watch your depth, you are not a dolphin!" 🐬 🐬 🐬 🐬

Diving Cabo Pierce in the actual Socorro Island, a small pod of four dolphins decided to delight our divemaster, Mari!
