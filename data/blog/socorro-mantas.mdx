The main reason I wanted to dive the Revillagigedos Islands was to see the giant manta rays. Although we saw them in each of our dives, they were aplenty at the various sites of Socorro Island including Cabo Pierce and Punta Tosca.

The giant oceanic manta ray can grow up to 30 feet in length and to a disc size of 23 feet across. They have triangular pectoral fins which serve as their "wings" and a pair of cephalic fins at the front of their heads.

It was so cool to swim with up to one and look at it straight in the eye.

What I saw was a very majestic and gentle giant that was so beautiful to watch. I learned that mantas hold their cephalic fins in an "O" shape to create a funnel that pushes water and their prey through their mouths. Additionally, every manta has a unique belly spot pattern, similar to a human fingerprint, helping to identify them.
