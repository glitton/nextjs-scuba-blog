<small>Describe</small>

I learned how to use Lightroom about three years ago but really started to get into it last year, 2023. I attended a wide-angle photography and beginner Lightroom bootcamp workshop at the Little Cayman Beach Resort. This year, I returned to Little Cayman and took week-long intermediate/advanced Lightroom bootcamp led by Adobe ACE and underwater photography expert, [Erin Quigley](https://www.goaskerin.com/about/).

Prior to this workshop, I would process my photos using Auto and then dial down the different settings until I was satisfied with the look of the photo. By the end of the week, I finally understood what to look for and where to start!

When starting the development process, ask yourself three questions:

1.  Is the image too bright or too dark?
2.  Does the image have a dominant and unwanted colors (too yellow, too green, too blue)?
3.  Are there areas in the image that need to be adjusted independently (subject too dark, background too bright)?

By answering the above questions, I was able to get into a workflow that made sense. Here are my key takeaways:

1.  Use the histogram to adjust the tonal details of the image.
2.  The color mixer panel provides more fine tuned color adjustments to your photos.
3.  Masking is so powerful! I used the linear and radial gradients in many of my photos and it really brought my subjects to life!

We also delved into Photoshop and I learned how to use the Generative AI tools to remove and add details to the photo. More about the ethics of AI in a later post :-).

As a bonus, I learned how to position my strobes to light up my subjects properly. When I shot wide-angle, I realized that my strobes where positioned too low and I never understood why my photos were too dark. The solution was really simple. Position your strobes above the subject. Take some test shots and actually look at where the strobes hit the subject and then adjust accordingly. This one piece of advice was a game changer for me!

For example, when I shot this barrel sponge, I was using a vertical perspective. Thus, I had both strobes way above my camera in the [bark-at-the-moon position](https://www.backscatter.com/reviews/post/How-To-Underwater-Strobe-Flash-Placement).

Prior to Erin's advice, I had both strobes above the handle sort of like at 11 and 1 o'clock. In fact, Erin swam over to me and re-positioned my strobes. Ahh, what a difference!

When shooting small subjects, I learned how to use one strobe for lighting in order to have a more dramatic effect. Here's a sample of a lettuce slug where I just used one strobe.

I also learned how to get a dark background by using the highest shutter speed and aperture which got me these two shots of these juvenile (name of fish) which were both swimming so fast that patience was a virtue!
