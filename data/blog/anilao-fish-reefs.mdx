Anilao boasts not only nudibranchs and muck critters, it also has beautiful reefs and a variety of fish that would wow the non-photographer diver 🐟 🐠 🐡.

My favorite coral reef sites for this trip include Sombrero Island, Koala, Mainit Corner, and Arthur's Rock.

While diving Sombrero Island, we saw schools of fish like the ones that my buddy Linda Elliott photographed below.

The site also had large sponge barrels. Thank you Linda for being my model!

Tiny fish were also spotted like this juvenile boxfish.

I got to see an octopus during the day which is so rare and fun 🐙 🐙 🐙!

The highlight for me was seeing blennies! We spotted several (up to eight) inside the holes of a brain coral at the Koala dive site.

And another at one of the muck dive sites, Octo point, taking residence in a bottle.
