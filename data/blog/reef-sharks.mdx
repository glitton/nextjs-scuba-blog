Cara or Face to Face. This site is where pregnant Caribbean reef sharks gather as they all know that there are divers coming to feed them. I've been on a similar dive like this one in Playa del Carmen where you get to see pregnant bull sharks so I was looking forward to it!

We got to the site at 6:30 am and got our feet wet by 7 am. The sharks were really cool but what I really enjoyed were the groupers who were hanging around.

One of them was watching the whole scene along with its diver friend ðŸ˜†.

We then headed to another site called 40 ft. which is the depth of the reef and also did a site called Captain G (named after me???) where I got to see this cool green moray eel peering from its hole.
