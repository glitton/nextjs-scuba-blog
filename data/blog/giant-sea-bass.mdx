During our first dive in Santa Barbara Island, we encountered a giant sea bass within 15 minutes. Seeing the size of this fish makes you ... These gentle giants average xx in size and can grow as big as xx.

My buddy Linda and I were thrilled that this fish stayed with us the whole dive. We treated it like a pup, coaxing it to come near us. This guy didn't disappoint.

This photo shows the size of the fish beside Linda.

This next shot looks like the sea bass had Linda for lunch nom nom nom.

Here's Linda aka the "fish doctor" seemingly checking the fish's heart :-).

I noticed that the sea bass had whiskers on its face which I later on learned were parasites (type of fish). I was thinking that perhaps this guy wanted us to scrape them off his face.

During our last dive day, we hung out again with a sea bass and Linda witnessed it throw up a navanax!

Lots of scorpion fish were a plenty and at first, it was hard to spot these guys as they blended with the rocky reef. This fish is definitely a master of disguise! 🥸

In all of the three dives, I spotted a slowly gliding torpedo ray.

Also known as the Pacific electric ray, the slow-moving torpedo ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity for the purposes of subduing its prey or for self-defense. Yikes, look but don't touch! 😱 ⚡ 🔌 ⚡ 😱

The highlight for me was meeting the devil of the Farnsworth kelp aka Linda Elliott. She was hiding behind the kelp and was nice enough to say hello 😈 👋 🤘🏼 😈.

Linda had on a hood with red horns making her so easy to spot. She was the subject of multiple photographs and we had several fun moments playing around. 😂 😆 😜

In addition to the spectacular dive conditions, we were enveloped by schools of sardines. I'd spot a sea lion or a sea gull dive down to catch some of the bait.

Check out the video with a special appearance by the devil herself, Linda Elliott 😈.
