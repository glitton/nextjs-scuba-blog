During our first dive in Santa Barbara Island, we encountered a giant black sea bass within 15 minutes. Seeing this fish was initially quite startling due to its size. This one was easily five feet long and as wide as a volkswagen bug. These gentle giants can grow up to 7 feet and can weigh more than 700 pounds! They are usually spotted swimming along the kelp at depths of 35 to 100 feet.

My buddy Linda and I were thrilled that this fish stayed with us the whole dive. We treated it like a pup, coaxing it to come near us. This guy was circling us the entire dive and we were fighting to keep up with it. I definitely took lots of photos!

Here are a few of my favorites:

This photo shows the size of the sea bass covering Linda.

This next shot looks like Linda is listening to the sea bass' heart, hey, she's a fish doctor too!

I noticed that the sea bass looked like it had whiskers on its face however, these things were moving. I learned that these were parasitic sea lice. I was thinking that perhaps this guy wanted us to scrape them off his face.

At one point, this guy was joined by another sea bass! All in all, we had three sea bass encounters during three separate dives. What a treat!
