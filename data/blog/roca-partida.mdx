Roca Partida is the smallest of the four Revillegigedo Islands (pronounced reh-vi-ya-hih-heh-doh). The fourth island, Clarion, was one that we didn't visit this trip.

The island looks like an iceberg with two tips on each side. However, just like an iceberg, there is more rock under it that stretches to about 5000 feet deep!

We did four dives on Roca Partida, starting off on one end of the island and then letting the current take us to the other end. Water temperature was steady at 78 degrees with the occasional thermocline at 77 degrees. By this time, I was wearing my 5mm wetsuit 🥶.

This island is known for the abundance of white tip reef sharks laying on top of each other on ledges or crevices. Seeing these sharks up close was definitely a delight 👀 😂.

The sharks were also near the surface and looked to be feeding on the plankton. White tip reef sharks are pretty harmless so getting up close to them was not scary at all.

Other critters where trumpet fish, large schools of jacks and even dolphins! More about the dolphins on another blog 😁 🐬.
