Roca Partida is the smallest of the four Revillegigedo Islands. The fourth island, Clarion, was one that we didn't visit this trip.

The island looks like an iceberg with two tips on each side. However, just like an iceberg, there is more rock under it that stretches to about 5000 feet deep!

We did four dives on Roca Partida, starting off on one end of the island and then letting the current take us to the other end. Water temperature was steady at 78 degrees with the occasional thermocline at 77 degrees. By this time, I was wearing my 5mm wetsuit 🥶.

This island is known for white tip reef sharks seemingly laying on top of each on ledges or crevices. Seeing these sharks up close was definitely a delight to see 👀 😂.

The sharks were also near the surface and seemed to be feeding on the plankton.

Other critters where trumpet fish, large schools of jacks and even dolphins! More about the dolphins on another blog 😁 🐬.
