<small>Tubulate sponge. Does it look like something familiar?</small>

My dive buddy in this trip, Deb Stewart, explained why Little Cayman is an ideal dive destination for improving one's underwater photography skills. There are numerous subjects that are very interesting and don't move like the various types of sponges such as barrel, tubulate, yellow tube, elephant ear, red encrusting sponges and many more.

During this trip, I started photographing sponges that reminded me of various everyday things.

Like this "hair-on-fire" looking sponge ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.

And this open-mouthed face looking sponge which I photographed at the Bloody Bay Wall in the Mixing Bowl site in the south side ðŸ˜®.

While learning Photoshop, I was able remove the divers on the top as well as extend the sponge image to extend the cut-off piece. Photoshop has a generative fill and expand function which are AI tools that uses machine learning to add, remove, or edit images (fill) as well as expand or fill an image's empty space (expand). They are interesting features that that have caused [copyright concerns](https://mashable.com/article/adobe-unveils-ai-features-photoshop-copyright-concern) so best to use these images for non-commercial use.

Here's what the open-mouthed sponge looks like now using Photoshop generative fill.

Towards the end of the dive, I spotted this sponge which looked like the middle-finger ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ¤£ ðŸ˜‚.

In class, Erin used Photoshop to add a mermaid to it. So I tried it myself.

Pretty funny, eh ðŸ˜†?
