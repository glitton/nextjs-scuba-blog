We spent the latter part of our Maldives trip scuba diving in Fuvahmulah (pronounced foah-muh-lah). Although this southern most island is known for tiger shark diving, you can find oceanic mantas (the big kind), whale sharks, mola mola, whales, and a variety of sharks (threshers, hammer heads, silver tips, reef) as well as schools of tuna, barracuda and more. Tiger sharks are present year round while the mantas, threshers, whale sharks, molas, and hammer heads are seasonal.

We dove with [Pelagic Divers Fuvamulah](https://www.pelagicdiversfuvahmulah.com/) and they arranged all of our logistics including the diving, our hotel, flights and airport transfers.

All our dives included the tiger shark dives where a group of divers gather at a spot called Tiger Harbor. Every dive shop is allocated a 30-minute dive slot per day.The divers jump into the water at the reef beside the tiger shark site and we descend to about 30 feet and swim to the site. Once we reach the main site, we descend to about 25 feet all in a row on the sand, hold on to the concrete blocks or rocks and watch the show. All of the tiger sharks that gather in this area are pregnant thus all are female.

I didn't use any lights or flash but fortunately there was some sun and we weren't very deep so I got some decent video and pictures.

You noticed one shark that had a bit of a crooked jaw or a natural smile. Her name is Jawgina üòä.

Here's the other side of Jawgina. She's got some rope stuck in her mouth and she's a big girl. I estimate her to be a little more than 7 feet or 2 meters üòÆ‚ÄºÔ∏è

The sharks swam really close to us, so close that I could've touched them! We had safety divers behind us so we felt safe the whole time.

We also did another tiger shark dive where we hovered on top of the reef and the sharks were swimming below us. It felt like we were more in their natural setting.

This was such a cool experience and I would definitely recommend it!
