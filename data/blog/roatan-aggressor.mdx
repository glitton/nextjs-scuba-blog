As a birthday present to myself, I took a liveaboard scuba diving trip aboard the Roatan Aggressor in Honduras. When I tell my friends about this, they give me a funny look cause they aren't familiar with the term "liveaboard." It's basically living on a boat where you eat, sleep, dive repeat for 7 days.

It's the first time I've done a liveaboard by myself so I was a bit nervous about not knowing anybody. My fears dissipated immediately as everyone on board especially the crew were all fabulous. The plan was to do a few dives in Roatan, head over to Cayos Cochinos, then Utila, then finally end in Roatan.

We boarded the yacht on Saturday late afternoon, got settled and had a nice dinner. We sailed away to our first site called Valle of the King.

The water temperature was warmer than normal, averaging 85 degrees. There definitely was some coral bleaching which is kinda sad üòû. I spotted the usual Caribbean critters such as blennies, flamingo tongue and seargent major fish.

We then headed to Mr. Bud's a shrimp boat purposely sunk. Among the soft coral, the divemaster found a seahorse!

We also did a night dive at this site were we saw a few octopi (octopuses?)üêô.
