My scuba diving trips would never be complete without photographing my favorite critters: blennies!

The Sea of Cortez had numerous blennies as well as nudibranchs that I've never seen before so I was extremely happy to spot them.

We dove the Fang Ming shipwreck during day 3. In April of 1995, the Mexican Navy caught the Chinese fishing boat which was on an illegal mission to smuggle immigrant Chinese workers to the US.

The [Seawatch organization](https://www.seawatch.org/) had the idea to make this vessel an artificial reef and thus made it a reality in November 18, 1999.

This site housed many small critters which I happily hunted for. Here's a shot of me trying to find these small critters among a school of french grunts.

I saw several of the Agassiz's Nudibranch at the wreck site.

As well as the Tamba eliora species of nudibranch.

There were also numerous blennies such as the Panamic barnacle blenny which looks spectacular with its blue spots.

And the always smiling Bluestriped fangblenny which is the photo at the top of this blog.
