<small>Thanks to Geny Marion for my scuba mascot.</small>

Roca Partida is the smallest of the four Revillagigedo islands. Jutting out of the surface are two peaks about 30 feet apart. Below the surface you can find lots of sea life from white tip sharks, schooling jacks, to moray eels and many more.

For this trip, I had a very amusing encounter with a very curious juvenile hog fish. 🐠🫧🪼🐟

This curious fish kept following me and I realized that it was seeing its reflection on my camera dome! ˙✧˖°📷 ༘ ⋆｡˚  
It was likely wondering "who is this fish who looks just like me???" I was so amused that I took some pictures of this guy. 🤣

He also said hello to Linda who was enchanted by this very cute and curious critter.

Not to miss were the white tip reef sharks which were ever present in the "balconies" of Roca Partida.

There were a number of pregnant sharks swimming about and lots of young ones huddled up in the crevice to stay warm.

The visibility was great at this time, over 50 feet and there were lots of schooling fish. Check out the video to see what I'm taking about.

Roca Partida is definitely one of the best dive sites in the Revillagigedo Islands. Although the currents at the edges can be tricky, diving on one side or the other still ranks as one of my all time favorite dive spots.
