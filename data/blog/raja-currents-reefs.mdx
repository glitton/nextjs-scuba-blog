Raja Ampat is known for strong currents. Majority of the dive sites particularly in the West and South sides were pinnacles. Strong currents exists in the corners of the pinnacles thus we were all armed with reef hooks prepared to stabilize ourselves as we swam between pinaccles and watch the show!

Here's a photo of Deb Stewart photographing me while hooked on a reef as well as a shot of her "flying" in the current.

And here's a shot of Linda at Boo Window where she's hanging on and trying to not get swept by the currents ðŸ˜‚.
