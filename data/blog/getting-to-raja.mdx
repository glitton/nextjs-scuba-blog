After more than a year of planning, the day is finally here! Feb. 5, 2025, I flew from San Francisco to Manila for a 15 hour layover then headed to Jakarta and finally Sorong where I will board the Ambai for a 12 day scuba adventure diving Raja Ampat!

The journey was long and spanned three days but I got to learn about Indonesia and its interesting culture.

After the Manila layover, I landed in Jakarta at about 12:15 am and I booked a bed at the Digital Hotel which had "capsule" like beds, good enough to spend the night as my next flight was not until 12 hours later.

I met up with my California dive buddy, Deb Stewart, for lunch and later on, my Canadian buddy, Linda Elliott. There were staying at a nearby airport hotel so we all hung out until our next flight.

After three days of traveling, we have finally arrived! We got to Sorong early in the morning where we stayed for one more night before boarding the Ambai.

We boarded the boat around 11:30 am and we did our checkout dive near Sorong at around 2 pm. The visibility was quite poor and Linda and I lost our group within five minutes! Oh well ...

Next blog is all about the various critters I saw during the first four dive days!

Thanks for reading my blog!
