After more than a year of planning, the day is finally here! Feb. 5, 2025, I flew from San Francisco to Manila for a 15 hour layover then headed to Jakarta and finally Sorong where I will board the Ambai for a 12 day scuba adventure diving Raja Ampat!

The journey was long and spanned three days but I got to learn about Indonesia and its interesting culture.

After the Manila layover, I landed in Jakarta at about 12:15 am and I booked a bed at the Digital Hotel which had "capsule" like beds, good enough to spend the night as my next flight was not until 12 hours later.

I met up with my California dive buddy, Deb Stewart, for lunch and later on, my Canadian buddy, Linda Elliott. There were staying at a nearby airport hotel so we all hung out until our next flight.

Finally, we got to Sorong early in the morning where we stayed for one more night before boarding the Ambai.

After three days of traveling, we have finally arrived!

This next shot looks like Linda is listening to the sea bass' heart, hey, she's a fish doctor too!

Here's a shot of the sea bass lurking behind Linda, uh oh 😨 😱 🙀.

The fish came up close so many times that I noticed that it had what looked like whiskers on its face. However, on my third encounter, these "whiskers" were moving all over the fish's face. I learned that they were not whiskers but parasitic sea lice. Perhaps this guy wanted us to scrape them off his face? 🤷🏽‍♀️¯

At one point, this guy was joined by another sea bass! All in all, we had three sea bass encounters during this trip. What a treat!
