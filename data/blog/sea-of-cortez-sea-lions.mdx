Day 2 of diving Sea of Cortez brought us to the islands of Las Animas and Espiritu Santo where there were sightings of hammerhead sharks and playful sea lions!

At Las Animas, during our morning dives we spotted about 20 hammerhead sharks swimming quite deep at over 100 feet so I got to see them from a distance. I tried to take a video but alas, the footage was quite grainy. But yes, I saw them and they were amazing!

In the afternoon, we spent our next two dives at Espirito Santo Island which is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site since 2005 and a National Park since 2007. We first went to Los Islotes, located at the northern tip of the island where we encountered very playful sea lions.

One of them tried to bite my fin

and my camera gear!

Although there were playful pups, the bigger male sea lion kept watch and I was a bit scared when he swam really close to me. I managed to get a picture of him and I guess he just wanted to make sure that I was a nice person ðŸ˜‚.

The dives were on the shallow side about 20 feet on average thus we were able to spend an hour with these playful pups.

The highlight for this day's dive was finding an octopus out in the open! This is indeed a rare occurence. She was trying to avoid us paparazzi by hiding in her hole but eventually she got out and I was fortunate to get a shot of her.
