Day 2 of diving Sea of Cortez brought us to the islands of Las Animas and Espiritu Santo where there were sightings of hammerhead sharks and playful sea lions!

The hammerhead sharks were swimming quite deep at over 100 feet so I got to see them from a distance. I saw over 20 of them

We left the dock around 10 pm and sailed for about 6 hours to our first dive site, Isla San Francisco.

After the morning's general dive briefing, we did our first checkout dive by 9:45 am and immediately, we saw a variety of critters including a variety of eels including the familar green moray eel

and the jewel eel which is endemic to the Sea of Cortez.

The water temperature was nice for this time of year, average of 81 degrees fahrenheit and visibility was wonderful, up to 80 feet at some spots. Here's the devil ðŸ˜ˆ, Linda, diving in her dive skins as she has "anti-freeze" for blood and can withstand long exposure to temperate waters without a wetsuit.

The highlight for this day's dive was finding an octopus out in the open! This is indeed a rare occurence. She was trying to avoid us paparazzi by hiding in her hole but eventually she got out and I was fortunate to get a shot of her.
