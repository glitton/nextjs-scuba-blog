The main reason I wanted to live in Mexico was to be able to dive pretty much year round. I live so close to many dive sites including the island of Cozumel which is known for large coral heads and amazing visibility.

Since I've been diving all over the world, I haven't been to Cozumel in over a year. My friends from pickleball, Camille and Kyle mentioned to me that they were going to be in Cozumel for three weeks so I asked if I could tag along for a few days.

Cozumel always surprises me. Even though I've gone diving in the island multiple times, I walk away with an amazing experience. For this trip, I encountered very friendly nurse sharks and turtles that decided to pose for me!

During multiple dives, we had encounters with nurse sharks who kept swimming beside us almost wanting to be petted like a puppy dog üê∂!

It's nice when the nurse sharks swim so close, I can get several photos! Here's the rest of my [nurse shark photos](https://generosalitton.smugmug.com/Cozumel-Turtle-NurseShark/n-MBqckP).

During another dive, we went to a swim-through and to my surprise, there was a turtle. Normally, I have to swim ahead to photograph turtles but this guy posed for me. So nice!

Here's another shot of a turtle this time with two queen angel fish wanting to get the scraps from the turtle's food.

My favorite turtle pic is where this guy is swimming to the surface.

Cozumel waters are so blue! Beautiful!

I'll be writing one more blog about the other sea life in Cozumel. Stay tuned!!!
