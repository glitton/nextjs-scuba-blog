I learned of the Picachu nudibranch (Thecacera pacifica) during this trip and it isn't easy to spot so having a world-class guide like Jerome helped tremendously! As you can see, it got its name from the Japanese Pokémon cartoon character which it resembles.

There are a variety of this type of nudibranch like this orange one.

And this other one that kinda looks like a cow (right Linda Elliott?) 🐮 🤣 🤣

This nudi kinda resembles a big so I'll call it my picachi pig nudi 🐷.

We also saw a family of Nembrotha nudibranchs while diving the site named Mainit corner.

I really like this shot of a nembro nudi crawling on a blue starfish.
