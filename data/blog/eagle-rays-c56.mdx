I never get tired scuba diving the C56 wreck in Puerto Morelos. It is almost guaranteed to see spotted eagle rays. And what a delight to see a number of them in this dive. Second only to the mantas, spotted eagle rays are one of the largest of eagle rays reaching widths of 3 meters or 11 feet. As their name implies the spotted eagle ray is covered in spots and other markings. They like to go to this site as there are always particulates in the water, which they feed upon.

Check out the the video of them at the C56 wrect in Puerto Morelos .
