After more than a year of planning, another dive from my bucket list has been completed: Tubbataha!

Growing up in the Phillipines, I always knew about my country's rich natural resources especially its oceans. Alas, due to corruption and greed, many of them have been destroyed or abused.

I am so thrilled to learn that the Phillipine government preserved Tubbataha and it is now a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://tubbatahareefs.org/) teeming with healthy coral, schools of fish, and deep walls.

The gang all met up in Puerto Princesa and boarded the Phillipines Aggressor for a six day adventure diving the various sites that Tubbataha has to offer and boy did it not disappoint!

One of the first things that I noticed were the size of the fish as well as the healthy corals.

The sites also had deep walls. As our dive briefings always stated (and we all memorized by the third day), "the site topography consists of a sandy slope leading to a deep wall." 😊

The Yucab reef is more of a flat reef with smaller corals. It has portions of sandy and grassy bottom especially at the end which meant lots of rays!
