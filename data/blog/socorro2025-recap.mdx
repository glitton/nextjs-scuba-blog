The Revillagigedo Islands is indeed a special place where you are guaranteed to swim with giant oceanic mantas, sharks and dolphins. This is the one dive site that I'd gladly return over and over again.

However, even for the one or two dives where there were no mantas, sharks or dolphin sightings, interacting with the usual ocean critters like lobsters, moray eels, butterfly fish and more gives me such a delight and reminds me why I make the effort to done the gear and set up the camera stuff. Yes, the juice is worth the squeeze.

I dive to be one with nature. I dive to appreciate the other things that make this earth special. I dive to connect with people of like minds. And the times that the dive is relatively uneventful, why not take a selfie like I did with my buddy Linda Elliott.

These are moments where I want to just pinch myself and realize how fortunate we all are to experience being with these wonderful ocean creatures.

Because the Revillagigedo Islands is a nature preserve, the critters that live in the area are not just more abundant but larger as well. There were lots of lobsters such as the one below that can feed the entire boat of 20+ divers!

The area also had a variety of trumpet fish such as the yellow one.

It's always so nice to see families of fish such as the damsel guarding her eggs. I tried to assure her that I just wanted a photo and nothing else.

And lastly, the giant oceanic mantas are what makes me always come back. These majestic gentle giants are so beautiful!
