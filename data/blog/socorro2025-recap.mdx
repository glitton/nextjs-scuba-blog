The Revillagigedo Islands is indeed a special place where you are guaranteed to dive with giant oceanic mantas, sharks and dolphins. This is one of the few places that I'd gladly return over and over again.

However, there were one or two dives where there were no mantas, sharks or dolphin sightings, interacting with the usual ocean critters like lobsters, moray eels, butterfly fish and more gives me such a delight and reminds me why I make the effort to don the gear and set up all the camera stuff. Yes, the juice is worth the squeeze. 🍊 🍋 🍋‍🟩

I dive to be one with nature. I dive to appreciate the other things that make this earth special. I dive to connect with people and share the beauty of the ocean. And the times that the dive is relatively uneventful, why not take a selfie like I did with my buddy Linda Elliott. 🤳🏽

Diving Socorro makes me realize how fortunate we all are to experience being with these wonderful ocean creatures.

Because the Revillagigedo Islands is a nature preserve, the critters that live in the area are not just more abundant but larger as well. There were lots of lobsters such as the one below that can feed the entire boat of 20+ divers!

The area also had a variety of trumpet fish such as the yellow one.

and moray eels.

It's always so nice to see families of fish such as the damsel guarding her eggs. I tried to assure her that I just wanted a photo and nothing else.

And lastly, the giant oceanic mantas are what makes me always come back. These majestic gentle giants are so beautiful! 🦋 🪷 🌊

Here's one more video showcasing these majestic creatures. Check out the 1:08 mark, you'll see a clarion angelfish nipping at the black manta's right wing. Cool, eh?
