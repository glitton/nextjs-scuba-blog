Alas, all fun things must come to an end. For our last dive day in the Sea of Cortez, we dove the island of La Reyna (some spell it as La Reina). I describe this site as a big underwater canyon with stunning rock formations, sea fan corals and large school of jacks! We were hoping to spot giant Mantas but we were not so fortunate this time. Another reason to come back 😊.

Instead, we were greeted with purplish-colored soft corals

A very large school of jack fish that covered the length of two football fields that at some point, they even blocked the sunlight 🤩 😮 🤯 ❗❗❗

and schooling grunts.

I managed to even find a tiny jawfish peering out of its hole in the sand 🐟.
