We had scheduled night dives pretty much every night except for one so I took advantage of it and did the second day night dive at ND Saporkren located in Waigeo Island (see map).

I thought the water temperature would cool down but no, it was still 83 degrees! We had three groups dive that day and one of the groups spotted another wobbegong shark.

I saw many other things, the highlights were a number of seahorses, here's a photo of one of them.

A frogfish which was quite difficult to spot,

An octopus with just it's head peering out of the sand

And my favorite, a bobtail squid!

There were other numerous critters such as various scorpion fish,

a very tiny cuttlefish, about an inch in size,

and even the leaf slug (Costasiella kuroshimae) Sean the sheep! Although this version seemed to be female due to the pink dots on its body so I called it Gabbie (an ode to my nephews girlfriend :-)
