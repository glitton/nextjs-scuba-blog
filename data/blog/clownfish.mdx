I learned that all clownfish are born male and then become female when the male’s partner dies. Thus, Nemo’s father, Marlin, should’ve turned into a female, Marlina. Don’t you think?

You likely have seen clownfish swimming inside anemones. I learned that they have a very symbiotic relationship wherein the clownfish provides the anemone nutrients in the form of waste while also scaring off potential predator fish. In return, the anemone provides the clownfish with protection and shelter.

The video below shows clownfish and anemones in the wild. It's nice to see how they help each other in this environment.
