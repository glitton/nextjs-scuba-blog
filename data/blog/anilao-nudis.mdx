I'm back in Anilao after a week diving Tubbataha on the Phillipines Aggressor. We were met at the airport by the [Crystal Blue Resort](https://www.divecbr.com/) van and we got to the resort 2.5 hours later.

The highlight of the dives were the nudibranchs which I wrote about [last time I visited Anilao](https://blog.glcodeworks.com/blog/nudis-aka-nudibranchs). This time, I saw more variety as our guide, Jerome, showed us some rare ones.

The above is a Goniobranchus Nudibranch (I believe???)

Nembrotha chamberlaini, which was a bit difficult to photograph because of the black color.

A nembrotha nudi look alike. This one is much smaller than the typical nembrotha nudi.{' '}

Curly looking nudibranch which is similar to a Unidentia Sandramillenae.
