Day 3 of diving led us to Cayos Cochinos which consist of two small islands and 13 smaller coral cays (pronounced keys) located on the northern shores of Honduras. Since the waters around these islands are government protected and off-limits to commercial divers and fishermen, the life and visibility were amazing!

The highlight of diving the bigger island, Coco Grande, were friendly nurse sharks who were looking for us to feed them some captured lion fish. Alas, none of us speared any so they stayed for a bit enough to brush my fingers. Suprisingly their skin felt rough, similar to a cat's tongue.

For the second dive of the day, we dove the smaller island and lo and behold, I found my favorite critter, the spineyhead blenny!
