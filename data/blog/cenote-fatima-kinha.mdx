The winds have been strong all week and the port has been closed so I took this opportunity to scuba dive cenotes that I haven't visited before. I am so lucky to live in Puerto Morelos where you can not only scuba dive in the ocean but also dive in various cenotes. It's also a nice way to stay cool as it has been unusually hot the last two weeks with temperatures in the mid-90s.

I typically go dive at Cenote Zapote (aka Hell's bells which you can read more about [here](https://blog.glcodeworks.com/blog/magic-in-the-jungle)). This time I was able to go to another special cenote called Fatima, named after the owner who is the sister of the owner of Cenote Zapote. I learned that only three guides in the whole of Mexico are allowed to dive this cenote. So why not, eh?

After diving it, I can say that I've found the real Upside Down ðŸ˜®!!!

If you've watched Stranger Things then you know what I'm talking about. If you're curious to know more, check out [this article](https://www.polygon.com/stranger-things/23191189/stranger-things-upside-down-explained).

I also dove Kin Ha which I already did before but having an expert guide makes a difference in the experience. I learned that this cenote housed abalone fossils and also has the largest stalactites in this area of Mexico.

Hope to dive more cenotes this year!
